compile time: compile source file
load time: link, load system library
run time: dynamically loaded system library

logical address: generated by CPU, also referred to as virtual address
physical address: address seen by the memory unit
same in compile-time and load-time, differ in run-time

MMU:
    hardware device that maps virtual to physical address.
    logical address _>   MMU   -> physical address
                        (relocation register)
                        (la + value in relocation register = pa)
    user program never sees the real physical addresses.
