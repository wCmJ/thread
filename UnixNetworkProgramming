problems of fork():
1.  fork is expensive. 
    descriptors are duplicated.
    regardless of COW, fork is expensive
2.  IPC
    return information from child to the parent takes more work

we get thread
1.  creation is 10-100 times faster than process creation
2.  information share become easy

got problem too:
    synchronization between shared source
every thread has:
    thread ID
    PC and SP
    stack(for local variables and return addresses)
